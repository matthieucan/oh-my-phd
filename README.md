## Productivity

* Inbox Zero

  Inbox Zero is a method amongst others to manage your email
  workflow. If you consider your Inbox being what you actually have on
  your mind at a certain time, Inbox Zero aims at having a clear view,
  processing/tagging/archiving your emails as soon as possible in
  order to always stay up-to-date.

## Researching

* LaTeX
  
  LaTeX is the de-facto tool to write high-quality scientific
  articles.  It respects standards and provides packages for almost
  everything you'll need, for example to write complex mathematic
  formulas.
